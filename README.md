## Description
Problem with KIIT ICT was that everyone's data was exposed as they use Excel sheets to manage, so I coded a website where only admins can access and manage user's (students in this case) data and can send pickup message reminders to the user that too only after authentication. And students can fill the required form to register their complaint and can track their complaint status from anywhere.
